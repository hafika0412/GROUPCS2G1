# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life cycle

The Gantt chart used to illustrate and document the project management life cycle enables the CloudRevel employees to occasionally adhere to the rules and reach the milestones. The project life cycle WBS divides each member's duties and work into a number of modules, including the project, procurement, and risk manager. Based on the created WBS, each member has their own roles and contributions to make at each point of the lifecycle.

Project management WBS is shown in the Gantt Chart below:

The Coin Counting Project's Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is designed to segment the technical portion of the project into many modules, including hardware and environment, image processing, and image analysis.

### Scope
A work breakdown structure (WBS) is created to map all the necessary tasks and develop the process which the WBS will be maintained and approved.

In this coin counting application, the scope of project will be identified. For instance, only coins from one country and coins from the current generation will be recognised by the project. For instance, each coin needs to be placed on the scanning surface independently. For example, the project will not accept bank notes as it will detect coins only. Next, the user must sort the coins instead of stacking them as the image processing need to captured it to do process. Besides, the other country such as Korea not be able to use this application because its coin size is applying for coins in Malaysia only. In addition, the fake coins will be identified and will not be counting.

### Risk Identification Chart (Quality, Cost, Time)

| Control Element | What is likely to go wrong? | How and when will I know? | What will I do about it? |
|-----|----|-------|-----|
|Quality <br> (Poor attitude toward quality; substandard design, materials, and workmanship; inadequate quality assurance program)|1. Inadequate Quality Assurance Program: The system can't differentiate fake and real coins <br> (Ex. circle things and coins) <br><br> 2. Inadequate Quality Assurance Program: The quality of the AI model is taking too much time to process the images.  |How: The output result will calculate total coins incorrectly <br> <br> When: The quality problem of will be determined during the unit testing phase|Assign one member to keep on testing the rules used to increased the accuracy until a satisfied result is determined.|
|Cost <br> (Estimating errors; inadequate productivity, cost, change, or contingency)|1. Contigency: If one of the developers forgets to shut down the EC2 instance while it's not in use, the server's cost will increase.|How: The monthly bills will show unexpected extra charged to the bills.<br><br>When: The problem most probably will be encountered during the project execution and project implementation.|Notify the owner through email or discord whenever budget exceed threshold in the AWS cloud computing service.
|Time <br> (Errors in estimating time or resource availability; errors in determining the critical path; poor allocation and management of float; early release of competitive products) | 1. Project not able to reach the milestone set  as described in the Gantt Chart. <br><br> 2. Erros in estimating resource availability: There are not enough server to be used to test the coin images  |How: The members are stuck with a certain problem and drag all the other team members <br><br> When: The problem will be encountered during the project excution and monitoring phase.| To prevent being caught in the problem loop, ask the other team members for assistance and swap their work or job to another one..|
