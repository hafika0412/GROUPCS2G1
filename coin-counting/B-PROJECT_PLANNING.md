# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life cycle

The Gantt chart used to illustrate and document the project management life cycle enables the CloudRevel employees to occasionally adhere to the rules and reach the milestones. The project life cycle WBS divides each member's duties and work into a number of modules, including the project, procurement, and risk manager. Based on the created WBS, each member has their own roles and contributions to make at each point of the lifecycle.

Project management WBS is shown in the Gantt Chart below:

The Coin Counting Project's Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is designed to segment the technical portion of the project into many modules, including hardware and environment, image processing, and image analysis.

### Scope
A work breakdown structure (WBS) is created to map all the necessary tasks and develop the process which the WBS will be maintained and approved.

In this coin counting application, the scope of project will be identified. For instance, only coins from one country and coins from the current generation will be recognised by the project. For instance, each coin needs to be placed on the scanning surface independently. For example, the project will not accept bank notes as it will detect coins only. Next, the user must sort the coins instead of stacking them as the image processing need to captured it to do process. Besides, the other country such as Korea not be able to use this application because its coin size is applying for coins in Malaysia only. In addition, the fake coins will be identified and will not be counting.
